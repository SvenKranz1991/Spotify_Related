# "Spotify-Related"

Spotify-Related is a SPA / Website, where I wanted to make a Custom Playlist Generator that satisfies my taste as a music lover.

I also wanted to display those valuable Informations Spotify provides for each Track.
like
...the Key and Tempo of every Song
...the average Loudness
...the analysis Spotify makes for every Track

Especially the data was of high interested for me, since as a Sound Designer I was curious to see how and what Spotify stores about each track.

## Getting Started

I deployed the website on Heroku. So no need for cloning the repo. _yay_
You just need to have your Spotify Logins ready for the OAuth process.
